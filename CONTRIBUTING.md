Thanks for your interest in contributing! 

I don't have specific guidelines -- yet. 

Please be as descriptive as possible when submitting bug requests,
and clear as possible when submitting pull requests.

Do not be rude to people asking or answering questions, and do not use language that would create a hostile environment. Feedback should be constructive in nature without being needlessly harsh.

Suggestions and contributions are both welcome!
